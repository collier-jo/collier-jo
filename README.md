## Background 

An engaging, energetic, behaviour and test driven full stack developer, who has recently graduated from one of the UK’s leading bootcamps, [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I place learning, accessibility and creativity as core drives for my Programming Practice. 

Graduating from UAL in 2017, I travelled down many different paths - from working in recruitment for a homeless charity to working in first line IT to being part of an exhibition at the Tate Modern.

I love problem solving, however tenuous this has been the main link between the various jobs and hobbies I have undertaken. 

In the past 3 years I have linked my creative brain with its alternative ways of thinking with analytical and systematic approaches, this has been the catalyst to me starting a new journey into programming.

## Skills

### Problem Solving:

Having done 2 years working in front line IT support, I have been able to distill complex tasks into elegant solutions with a clear plan of attack, targeted resolve 80% of Service Requests/ Incidences on first contact. 

Alongside a calm, confident composure, step by step analysis is often key. Essential to success is often breaking the bigger issues into smaller bite sized problems, using targeted questioning to find the most likely solution, systematically working through the simplest answers before moving onto more complex resolutions. Though it is critical to keep an eye on the ‘bigger picture’, and maintain a solution orientated approach to ensure effective resolution.

These skills have been enhanced and honed to Coding during the 16 Week Makers Bootcamp. By following a strict debugging process, I have found my systematic and analytical approach to yield efficient solutions. 

    
### Teamwork:
During the Makers Bootcamp teamwork was integral, either we worked within an agile team or pair programming each afternoon. 

An example of this was during the [Acebook](https://github.com/edmond-b/acebook-NO-de-Problem) Challenge, for this challenge we managed our own work load by firstly creating an MVP project, which was run past our stack holder and changed accordingly. After, we worked on rolling 2 day sprits. To ensure communication and to manage work load we held daily standups and retros, often checking in via Slack after lunch. We would split into pair according to the estimate and would do ‘mob’ programming when encountering difficult bugs. 

### Creative thinking: 

Through the Makers Academy Bootcamp, I became away of the balance of two different worlds of analytical imagination, and build something out of nothing. These concepts came easy to me having digested them 4 years earlier during my Art Degree. 

During my time at Art School, we had to be ambitiously curious and self starting; we were given no brief and expected to present a fully realised piece backed with sustained lines of enquires. We had to tap into our passions, constantly testing ideas, back track and retrace concepts, collaborate and repetitive mastering of your materials/ tools. 



### Communication: 

Good communication is an integral skill to aiding efficiency, creating cohesive teams, build trusting and productive relations. 

**Strong Verbal/ Non-Verbal / Written:**

A good example of these skills was during my time as in 2nd Line IT Support,  a frustrated user had 25 unusable laptops 2 weeks before lesson started. Having discussed over phone and  email I knew we couldn’t deploy windows 10 owing to their low spec. Two things I knew going into the meeting 1) we could not help 2) this users was temperamental at the best of times. With this in mind, during the meeting, my verbal skills were understanding and sensitive however I kept my body language firm such as strong eye contact and minima but open body movement/ gestures. 

Through my confidence and diplomacy I was successfully able to de-escalate the users anger while also managing their expectations around a solution. 


**Translating jargon:** 

A key responsibly within my IT Support Role was to share complicated concepts, issues and university business direction to users in often emotionally charged settings.

This ran both ways - I would also have to take vague, non specialist understanding of IT problems and requests, and translate into technical, digestible with relevant business implications 


**Active & Empathic Listening to build working relations:** 

During my role as a Peer Advisor for Thames Reach Homeless Charity, I would have to actively listen to obtain key information, and hear the complete message being communicated to aid with their job hunt. Listening to understand someone was a vital skill in creating a realistic pathway and give constructive feedback. 

The ability to pin point the needs of a client and respond appropriately enabled the client to have clarity on steps needed to successfully get a job which in turn build trusting relations. 


## Experience 

### Digital Makers Collective 
*(Jan 2020 - Present)*
As well as Makers, I am part of a voluntary, informal Research & Development (R&D) who share common goals in exploring digital & emerging technologies in the context of arts practice, education, society and the creative industries. Recently we had an exhibition at the Tate Modern, Uni to Unicorns, which was a test bed for creative tech. https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/tate-exchange/workshop/uniunicorns. Working for DMC has given

    <summary>Click to see responsibilities</summary>

I learnt to couple my intuitive problem solving with systematic and analytical approaches. This experience. has greatly enhanced my debugging approach, allowing me to see faults as an unavoidable challengerather than a set back. I can break down the problem and work through the problem methodically until a
solution has been reached.  

While naturally I have strong communication skills, IT Support taught me the value of active listening and. targeted questioning to be able to unpick the customers needs, and efficiently resolve problems. A key responsibly within my IT Support Role was to share complicated concepts, issues and University business direction with non technical users. In reverse, I would also have to take vague, non specialist understanding of IT problems and requests, and translate them into technical, digestible with relevant business implications.
